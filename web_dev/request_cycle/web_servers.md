# vps
  A virtual private server is a virtual computer that has the same attributes of a real computer. It may download and run software like a regular computer. It is used mainly as a computer soley for the control of a web server. THe advantages of using a vps is making a computer only have one perpose so it is hard to mess it up by accidental viruses when searching the web for the cutest cat pics. Also you may use it without worrying about accidently running a wrong command line and deleting all your work and your files. Instead its just on a virtual computer os you wont have to worry about ruining your personal work computer for good which costs alot.

#bonus
  Its a good idea to not run as a root user because just like i stated in previous explanation. You want to make sure not to accidently shut down your whole system. If you run as a root user you have complete control of the server and as an administrative user you have no limits on your ability when it comes to the server. But if you run your server as a regular user you cant completely destroy everything from that level, so its safer.
